### What did I learn about HTML and CSS?

**HTML**

- Writing clean and maintainable HTML code
  - Proper use of semantic HTML elements

**CSS**

- Writing clean and maintainable CSS code
- Use of multiple CSS selectors: class, id, element, as opposed to just classes.
- Use of a framework.css file to declare reusable helper CSS classes and components.
- Use of a layout.css file in which more specific styles are declared relating to the project.
- You don’t need heights on grid items to equalise columns if you have the proper structure.
- I learnt to be more careful when introducing CSS class names as it can quickly become difficult to reason about. Class names should be introduced only if required: if a semantic element can be referred to by more specific nested selectors then that may be better than simply referring directly to the nested element via a class name.
- I found it a useful practice to split the layout.css file into different sections for ‘spacing’, ‘components’, ‘colours’ even if there are repeated selectors. Not having the spacings \- i.e. paddings, margins \- and colours mixed up improves readability and helps to focus on those specific aspects of the page, for instance, all of the text colours or background colours are grouped in the same area of the css file, separated from all of the css spacing code.

### Design tips for future self:

- Don’t start coding before completing the Design Phase: prototypes and mockups in Figma.
- Look for inspiration in interior design catalogues: colour relationships, spatial relationships, typefaces.
- Keep asking “is this element I am designing communicating its purpose?”
  - For instance, is there enough text to communicate the purpose of that component?
  - Does the font-sized of a heading communicate properly
- Get the styling of one or two sections right first and then the rest.
- Compile a list of inspiring web-design templates
- So much of design is dependent on good quality images
  - More research is needed on how to generate images that are suitable for websites, i.e. amount of information in the image, focal points, etc.
- Use Higher Order Components to apply project-wide paddings and margins so as not to lose unity.
- Refer to contemporary design sources from 2025, not outdated web-templates from 2018\.
- Get the content finalized early on \- i.e. text content, images, graphics, logo \- otherwise the design will have no anchor points to build around.
